            <h1>Food Aventures</h1>
            <p>After getting braces on I realised that I can no longer eat anything sold. So I've selected 5 foods that I can eat and satirized their recipes rather than create actual ones. If you just want to see food,  <a href="https://iamafoodblog.com/"> check out this blog!</a></p>
            <h2 style="color: royalblue"> Chicken Soup</h2> 
            <p> Filled with a variety of garden veg and chicken for protein there is nothing more you could want this winter.
            </p>

            <h2 style="color: royalblue"> Risoles & Mash</h2>
            <p> The soft texture of the mash potato really complements the meat. When you get braces you will find that chewing is difficult and so when the meat structure is set out like the beef risoles it will melt in the mouth with little to no chewing required. Avoid steam vegetables, for some reason restuarants think it is ok to undercook them and leave them hard.
