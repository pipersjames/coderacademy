### Q1 Identify and explain common and important components and concepts of web development markup languages.

---

Markup languages are used to communicate the structure, formatting and relational interactions of a document to facilitate automatic processing by the program that reads it. In the case of web development we are primarily concerned with **HTML** (used for structure), **CSS** (style/appearance), and **JavaScript** (fuctionality/interactivity).
Below are some key components and concepts for each of these languages;
1. HTML
- Elements: define different substructures of the webpage and written inbetween tags requiring both a start and end tag e.g. `<p></p>`. At minimum the webpage should include elements for the document type, the document itself, header and body to be functional e.g. of tags `!DOCTYPE, html, head, body`. Additional elements could include but are not limited to paragraphs, lists, tables, links or pictures. see [https://www.w3schools.com/html/].
- Attributes: provide additional information about an element and are specified inside of the start tag. For example the lang="en" inside of the following code block is an attribute to set the language for the html as english `<html lang="en">`

2. CSS
- Rulesets: are the core written structure of the CSS used to modify elements, classes, ID etc. of the html. They can either be written inside of the Html document(inline styling) or in an external CSS file (external styling). Rulesets include both a selector, and declaration.
- selectors: will target commonly target the elements, classes or ID's of the html code base and apply style to them.
- Declarations: include both the property and property value. Together they represents what part of the selector will be changed and how it will changed.
- cascading or specificity: It is important to note that CSS styles html in a hierarchical way, meaning that certain types of formatting will overwrite others if there is a conflict. For example, a style change to the "ID" will take priority over a "Class" style.
